This is just a poorly organized thoughts that come to me when reading the work of Jean-Paul Satre.

> _Most of those who are making use of this word would be highly confused if required to explain its meaning. For since it has become fashionable, people cheerfully declare that this musician or that painter is “existentialist.” A columnist in Clartes signs himself “The Existentialist,” and, indeed, the word is now so loosely applied to so many things that it no longer means anything at all._

The phenomenon seems to be omnipresent. I believe many of us have been in a situation, where we argued with someone about a particular issue, but it turns out it is a matter of misunderstanding upon certain concept, and the discussion was rendered meaningless because no one's really understood the other's opinion, not to mention leaning something through the conversation. And I believe this is the exact reason why in a debate contest, two teams will always have to fight for the definition of concepts.

This also leads me thinking of to two relevant topics, one from Wittgenstein

 > _“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” (Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt.)_
 
 who believe that language does not possess a fixed logic or structure, instead, they were given meanings in use, and it would change depends on context or what he called "language game".
 
 The other is the idea of **expansive interpretation** vs **extensive interpretation**. In civil law, these two terms are denoted as follows.

Expansive Interpretation
: Interpreting a legal provision in a way that extend its meaning while still staying within the possible linguistic meaning of the text
Extensive Interpretation
: Interpreting a legal provision in a way that goes beyond the literal meaning of the text

For example, if we interpret "mail" as "e-mail", this is expansive interpretation. On the contrary, if we interpret "woman" as "man", this is obviously an extensive interpretation.

We sometimes accept those interpretations because everything is evolving and the existing law might not cover all circumstances. For example, e-mail only emerged from 1971, before that, no legislation would considered crimes involving e-mail. Recently the cryptocurrency and LLMs also brings many challenges to our legal system. 

To deal with those challenges. We cannot only rely on revising the law, since it would be a difficult and lengthy process. Another solution is to develop a theoretical system for interpreting legal provisions, just as stated, "the point is how to interpret the law, not how to revise the law".
